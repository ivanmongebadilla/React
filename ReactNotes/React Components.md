Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

Components can be passed as `props` [[React Props]], which stands for properties.

Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.

You will learn more about `props` in the next chapter.
