-   The **ternary** operator (also known as the **conditional** operator) is so-called because it's the only JavaScript operator with **three operands**. (Ternary means "_composed of three parts_".)

```javascript
(condition to be evaluated) ? expression to execute if condition is truthy : expression to execute if condition is falsy
```
