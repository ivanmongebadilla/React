-   There are two ways to write components in React: **function** **components** and **class** **components**.
-   Before the introduction of **React** **hooks** [[ReactRouter (Hooks)]] in 2019, which provided function components with access to React features such as local component state, we had to use class components to access those features. Function components could not access them at all, so they were used only for simple components.  
    
-   Since the introduction of hooks, the React team now recommends that all new React components be written using function components going forward.
